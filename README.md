Currently this is mostly a UI concept, that can read local text files, manage
history, and allow the user to push buttons.

Build using [Retro68](https://github.com/autc04/Retro68/).

## TODO

- Implement scrolling
- Implement TCP
- Fetch pages over HTTP
- Parse HTML and maybe CSS
- Render pages

Parsing and rendering code could be taken from another browser project such as netsurf or Dillo.
